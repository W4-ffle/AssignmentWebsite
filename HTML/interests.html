                <h3>Music:</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        I play guitar in my free time and will bring it up with me to university next week. 
                        I enjoy listening to the
                        Red-Hot Chili Peppers and other genres of music. 
                        I also listen to techno music because it is a very large
                        genre in Sligo (where I&rsquo;m from).<br>

                <h3>Exercise:</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        I enjoy regular exercise as I find it calming and a great time to listen to music, 
                        I also find it helps with my
                        coding as I can step away from a problem and explore my options in my head as I work out. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Cooking:</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        I have worked as a chef for two summers, 
                        so I have a keen interest in cooking and eating all different
                        kinds of foods and experimenting with my own dishes for my own enjoyment and the enjoyment of
                        others.

                <h3>Gaming:</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        I have spent a lot of my time gaming and while in recent years I have moved away from it I still attempt
                        to play when I can as I find it both fun and relaxing. I play games like CS:GO, Rust, Valorant, Minecraft
                        and other smaller story games. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Cars:</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    I also enjoy cars and working on them, I have always liked cars from a young age as both my parents were rally 
                    drivers for <abbr title="Sligo Stages Rally">SSR</abbr> and Rally Ireland so i was always subjected to them from a young age. They used to own a red Honda Civic which I still 
                    can't believe they sold as I was looking at buying one online the other day.<br>
